<p>Before we start, let me remind you that:
    <ul>
        <li>The length of a match is randomly determined.</li>
        <li>After each round, there is a {{continuation_chance}}% probability that the match will continue for at least another round.
        <li>This is how the length of a match is determined: at the end of each round, the computer rolls a fair 100-sided die.
            If the die comes up {{die_threshold_plus_one}} or more we do not continue to another round, and the match is over.
            If the die comes up {{continuation_chance}} or less, we continue to another round of the same match.
            We continue to more rounds, until {{die_threshold_plus_one}} or more
            is rolled at the end of a round and the match ends.</li>
        <li>You will play with the same person for the entire match.</li>
        <li>After a match is finished, you will be randomly paired with another person for a new match.</li>
    </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Are there any questions before we start with the paid matches?</p>
